            <p>Your trip to Thailand will not be complete without a taste of its world-renowned cuisine and dishes.
                Aside from being aromatic and healthy, Thai food is also a unique blend of varying flavors and textures
                as it mixes around the 5 essential flavors: salty, sour, spicy, bitter, and sweet!</p>

                <h4>Variants of Fried Rice in Thailand</h4>
                <p>Thailand is a foodie’s dream destination. Bangkok, the capital city, is thought of to be the Street
                    Food Capital of the World . I’m so glad I got to travel to
                    this beautiful country a few years ago, try out their delicious food. food is awesame in the word.
                    It
                    was a memorable trip! Someday, I want to go back there again.</p>

                <h4>ASIAN SALAD RECIPE</h4>
                <p>This super easy to make Asian salad recipe is packed full of healthy veggies and tossed in a tasty
                    sesame ginger salad dressing. It's fresh and crunchy and a crazy delicious side dish.
                    This Asian salad recipe is hard not to fall in love with. Not only is it one of the tastiest salads
                    ever, but it's also super healthy. Like super crazy healthy.</p>

                <h4>Thai Beef Salad</h4>
                <p>I’m probably completely biased, but I think that Asian salads are the best in the world. I love them
                    because they are interesting and the dressings are so good.
                    The chances of me ordering a salad at any restaurant other than an Asian one is almost zero.
                    However, at Asian restaurants, there is a prospect of it happening!!</p>
